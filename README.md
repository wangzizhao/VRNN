# Generative Time Series Forecasting

This repository contains our code, data, results and report for the project of the course Probabilistic Programming instructed by Alp Kucukelbir during Fall 2018 at Columbia University.<br>

In this project, we applied VRNN model and improved VRNN model on stock prices data. The model is available [here](https://github.com/wangzizhao/VRNN/blob/master/model.py) and the trainer is available [here](https://github.com/wangzizhao/VRNN/blob/master/trainer.py). The results which are comparisons between the true and predicted value are available [here](https://github.com/wangzizhao/VRNN/tree/master/final-project/experiments).<br>

The final report is available [here](https://github.com/wangzizhao/VRNN/blob/master/final-project/final-notebook.ipynb).<br>
